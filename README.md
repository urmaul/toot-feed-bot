# toot-feed-bot

A bot that forwards toots from your Fediverse feed to your matrix inbox.

It's in active development and nothing is stable. It is also usable if you manage to configure it. Currently supports only a single subscription on a Pleroma server. Check [config.ts](https://github.com/urmaul/toot-feed-bot/blob/main/src/config.ts) to see required configuration values.
